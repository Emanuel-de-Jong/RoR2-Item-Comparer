# RoR2-Item-Comparer
 
## Description
A mod for Risk of Rain 2 that counts all the players items and displays their total worth to them.
Some items have a different value because they are better.
This way you can easily see who should get the next item by looking at the points.
The mod itself is in /ItemCounter/bin/Debug/. 
If you change anything, like the value a rarity gives, you'll have to recompile it.
