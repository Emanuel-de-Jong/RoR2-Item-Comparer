# RoR2 Item Comparer
A mod for Risk of Rain 2 that counts all the players items and displays their total worth to them.

Some items have a different value because they are better. This way you can easily see who should get the next item by looking at the points. The mod itself is in `/ItemCounter/bin/Debug/`.

If you change anything, like the value a rarity gives, you'll have to recompile it.

This is not a real screenshot of the mod in action but rather edited to show how the mod functions. The real mod looks better and uses actual player names.
